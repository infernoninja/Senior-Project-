# Senior-Project
My senior project covers the adversarial robustness of a neural network. I am covering the image classification of the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets by creating a neural network from TensorFlow and Keras and then adverserially testing and training the network. I hope to learn the math behind a neural network and the how we can prevent an ML system from crashing under Black Swan events. 

The complete_saved_mnist_model is the save files for the Neural Network architecture. 

Currently, a lot of the code is clunky, and I am in the process of editing them. I will let you know when I have fixed all the code.
